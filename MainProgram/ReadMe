To run the program, run on python 3 from module.

Input two strings, one to convert to another.
This can be done in two ways, first of which is to input two strings into the maxtrixInitiate function on line 220 in main().
The second way is to input the two strings in inFile1 and inFile2, then input s1 and s2 maxtrixInitiate function on line 220 in main().

The corresponding results are outputted to the actionFile.

The actionFile gives a series of instructions as to the most efficient way of converting string 1 into string 2.
ADD or DEL means add or delete letters.
The first number represents position in string 1 where add or delete action applies.
The second number presents number of letters deleted or added.
In add the last letters represent what letters are added.

Actions are in reverse, so the last actions should be applied first.
